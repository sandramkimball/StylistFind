# StylistFind-FE
Practice building react-app, ReactJs, google-map library.

## Todo:

- Work on backend to deliver proper data for review cards: salon name, and limited stylist and user info...
- pass props from home pg search to search pg
- add func to sort, filter by in filter-bar
- figure out why not getting both user data and user post data (flatten two axios arrays?)
- reinstate profile edit, add-image, post, review forms
- stylist signup: be sure address is posted to salon, not stylist
- add restrictions back to api paths
